Express is a nodejs framework 
 
Install Express
- we have to make a root folder 
- we have to make a file_name.js file and initialize npm init in the root folder to make package.json file 
- then Install it using npm install Express

Then to use express we have to  
go to the file_name.js

write 
const express = require("express");
const app  = express();
app.listen(3000,function(){
    console.log("server started")
});

//So now the server got started and now we have to make requests to server 

for that we need to use get 

app.get("/",function(reqest,response){
    response("hello");
})
